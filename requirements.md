# Student Learning Platform Requirements

## Overview
A modern, responsive web application for delivering educational content through an interactive learning experience. The platform supports course management, module-based learning, note-taking, and resource sharing, with a focus on maintainable and scalable development practices.

## Development Guidelines

### File Modifications
- SQL migration files in `/home/project/supabase/migrations` must NEVER be edited
- New migrations must be created as separate files with complete content
- Changes must be formatted as clean, unambiguous diffs
- Build upon the most recent version of files
- Provide sufficient context to avoid ambiguity
- Maintain exact indentation and whitespace
- Order hunks sequentially from top to bottom
- Use only existing context lines

### Terminal Commands
- Use `type="start"` for application/project startup commands
- Use `type="shell"` for other terminal operations
- Dev server restarts are handled automatically after shell commands

### Dependencies
- Always prioritize package.json updates for new dependencies
- Install required dependencies before other operations
- Automatic dependency installation occurs on package.json updates
